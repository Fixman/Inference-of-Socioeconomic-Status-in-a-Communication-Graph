\subsection{Matching between bank and telco telephones}

Of the \num{24040415} bank accounts of which we have information, \( ? \) have some cellphone number registered and \( ? \) match with one of the phone numbers given to us by the telco. We also combine the age and gender data provided by the bank with the one provided by the telco for the gender and age ground truth.

Since the bank gives us income data for most of its users, we can use that data as \textbf{Ground Truth} for the Reaction Diffusion algorithm with the phone data and get a good estimate for income for \( ? \) users.
