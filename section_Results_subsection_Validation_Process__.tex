\subsection{Validation Process}

We need to make sure that our inference algorithm correctly predicts users' income, we create a binary classifier between two equally sized groups, \textbf{wealthy} users and \textbf{poor} users. Our hypothesis is that if there's a link connecting two users then both of them will be in the same group.

We can use this prediction method to classify the links between users in $ G $ for which we know the income using this hypothesis into four classes depending on the group of each member of the link:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{r|c|c} \hline
& Predicted Wealthy Group & Predicted Poor Group \\ \hline
Condition Positive & True Positive & False Negative \newline (Type II Error) \\ \hline
Condition Negative & False Positive \newline (Type I Error) & True Positive \hline
\end{tabularx}

To validate this, we use a \textbf{Received Operating Characteristic Curve} to calculate
