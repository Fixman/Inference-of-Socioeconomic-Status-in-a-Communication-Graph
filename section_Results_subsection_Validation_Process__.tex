\subsection{Validation Process}

We need to make sure that our inference algorithm correctly predicts users' income, we create a binary classifier between two equally sized groups, \textbf{wealthy} users and \textbf{poor} users. Our hypothesis is that if there's a link connecting two users then both of them will be in the same group.

We can use this prediction method to classify the links between users in $ G $ for which we know the income using this hypothesis into four classes depending on the group of each member of the link:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|r|c|c|}
& Predicted Wealthy Group & Predicted Poor Group \\
Condition Positive & \cellcolor{green} True Positive & \cellcolor{red} \makecell{False Negative \\ (Type II Error)} \\ 
Condition Negative & \cellcolor{red} \makecell{False Positive \\ (Type I Error)} & \cellcolor{green} True Positive \\
\end{tabularx}

To validate this, we use a \textbf{Received Operating Characteristic Curve} to calculate
