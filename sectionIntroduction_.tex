\section{Data Source}

\subsection{Mobile Phone Data Source}

The data used in this study consist of \textbf{Call Detail Records}, or CDRs, made on calls and text messages from a Mexican telco in a period of \( M \) months (\( M = 3 \)), denoted by \( L \). Every CDR contains the anonimized phone numbers of the two participants in the communication \(\left<o, d\right>\), the call time \( t \), and, in the case of CDRs for phonecalls the call duration \( s \). A subset of these calls also contain the latitude and longitude of the call's antenna, \( \left<y, x\right> \).

\( L \) contains calls and messages whos origin or destination are users in the telco, but it doesn't include communications between the great amount of users which aren't part of this. Defining \( N \) as the users of the telco, and \( L_N \) as the calls where \( o \in N \wedge d \in N \), we can create a communications graph \( G_N \) that contains all calls between their users.

With the data provided to us by the telco, \( G_N \) contains \( ? \) users who made \( ? \) calls with a total of \( ? \) minutes and sent \( ? \) text messages.
