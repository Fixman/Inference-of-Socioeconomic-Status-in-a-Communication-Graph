\section{Data Source}

\subsection{Mobile Phone Data Source}

The data used in this study consist of a set \( \mathlarger{P} \) of \textbf{Call Detail Records} (CDRs), composed of voice calls and text messages from a Mexican telecommunication company (\textit{telco}) for a 3 month long period.
Every CDR \( p \in \mathlarger{P} \)  contains the anonimized phone numbers of the caller and callee \( \left< p_o, p_d \right> \), the start time \( p_t \), and, in the case of voice calls, the call duration \( p_s \). 
The latitude and longitude of the antennae used for the calls \( \left< p_y, p_x \right> \), are also given for a small subset of the data.

Given that our collection \( \mathlarger{P} \) of CDRs are coming from the same telephone company, we are able to reconstruct all communication links between clients of this company, as well as communications between the clients and other users, but we have no information on comunications where neither users are clients of our telco company.

If we define \( N \) as the users of the telco, and \( \mathlarger{P}_N \subseteq \mathlarger{P} \) as the calls where \( \left( \forall p \in \mathlarger{P}_N \right) p_o \in N \wedge p_d \in N \), we can create a communications graph \( \mathlarger{G} \) which contains only the users from the telco and all of the calls between them.

With the data provided to us by the telco, \( \mathlarger{G} \) contains \num{72107108} users who made \num{72107108} calls and sent \num{634225740} text messages in this period of 3 months.
