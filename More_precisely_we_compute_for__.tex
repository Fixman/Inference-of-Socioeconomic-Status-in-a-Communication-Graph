To infer this we compute the call distribution for each user $ \mathlarger{G}_W $ to the wealthy category its call distribution to the high income category and denote it as $\alpha)$ . Here $\alpha$ was the fraction of outgoing callas records ($p_k$) that user $g_k$ has to the income category $c_h$. These calls distributions $\alpha_{(k)}$ were used as the parametrization of a Beta distribution $B(\alpha_k)$ for each user $k$. Then, interpreting the sample space of $B(alpha_k)$ as a discrete probability distribution and considering the homophily assumption,  we expected that users belonging to $c_h$ tends to be a concentrated to this particular category. In other words we take the Beta sample space $vec{1-p_h,p_h}$ as a proxy of belonging to different income categories.
