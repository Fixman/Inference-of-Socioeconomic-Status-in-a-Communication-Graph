%For each pair \( \left< o, d \right> \in {G_N}_L \) we define \( X \), as the set of incomes for callers and \( Y \) as the set of incomes for callees. According to hour hypothesis, \( X \) and \( Y \) should have a significant correlation.

%We can use the \textbf{Spearman's rank correlation coefficient} to test the statistical dependence of the sets \( X \) and \( Y \). This is an improvement over the usual Pearson correlation coefficient in that we compare the ranks of each datapoint, and therefore we get a good coefficient on both people with low and high income levels.

%\[
%r_s = \mathlarger{\rho}_{\operatorname{rank}(X) \operatorname{rank}(Y)} = \frac{\operatorname{cov}(\operatorname{rank}(x), \operatorname{rank}(y))}{\sigma_{\operatorname{rank}(X)} \sigma_{\operatorname{rank}(Y)}}
%\]

%Using this coefficient, we get a correlation of \( \num{0.474} \), where the P-value of the null hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the income level between callers and callee isn't correlated is \( P < 10^{-6} \).
