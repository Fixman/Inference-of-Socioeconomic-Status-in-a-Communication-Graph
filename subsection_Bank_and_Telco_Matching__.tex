\subsection{Bank and Telco Matching}

Since the phone numbers in each call of the telco data $ p_o $ and $ p_d $ are anonymized with the same hash function as the phone number in the bank data, $ b_p $, we can match users to his unique phone create another social graph $ G = P \bowtie_{_{p_o = b_p}} B \bowtie_{_{p_d = b_p}} B $ which includes income information to the subset of the social graph that appears in the bank data. This graph represents has \num{2027554} nodes with \num{5044976} edges, representing \num{29599762} calls and \num{5476783}.
