\subsection{Bank and Telco Matching}

Since the phone numbers in each call of the telco data $ p_o $ and $ p_d $ are anonymized with the same hash function as the phone number in the bank data, $ b_p $, we can match users to his unique phone create another social graph $ G = P \bowtie_{p_o = b_p} B \bowtie_{p_d = b_p} B $ which includes income information to the subset of the social graph that appears in the bank data. This graph represents has 2 million nodes with 5 million edges, representing 30 million calls and 5 million SMS.
