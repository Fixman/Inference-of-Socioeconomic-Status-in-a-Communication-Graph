\subsection{Bank and Telco Matching}

Thanks to \( b_p \) being anonimized in the same way that \( p_o \) and \( p_d \), we can match bank users to their mobile phones, and add income data to \( G \) as \( g_s \). The subset of calls \( H \subset G \) where both users have income information from the bank has \num{2027554} users, and \num{5044976} edges which represent \num{29599762} calls and \num{5476783} SMS.
