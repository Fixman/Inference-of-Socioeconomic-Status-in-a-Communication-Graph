More precisely, we first compute for each user $g_k$ its call distribution  across the defined income categories and denote it as $\vec{\alpha} =(\alpha_i); i \in [1,5], i\in \mathbb{N}$ . Here $\alpha_i$ was the fraction of outgoing callas records $p_k$ that user $g_k$ has to the income category $c_i$. These calls distributions $\vec{\alpha_k}$ were used as
