\subsection{Banking Information}

The dataset used in this study also contains information about account from a big bank in Mexico for a period of 6 months, denoted \( \mathlarger{B} \). Each bank dataset \( b \in \mathlarger{B} \) contains one phone number \( b_p \), which is anonymized with the same hash function user in \( \mathlarger{P} \), and the real income of this person in the 6 months \( b_{s_0}, \ldots, b_{s_5} \). We average these 6 values to get \( b_s \), a measurement of a user's income.

The bank also provides self-reported personal data about the users: \( b_a \), the age of the user, and \( b_g \), its gender. We use this data to manage biases in the inference algorithm, and to measure homophily with user data other than income.

\subsection{Bank and Telco Matching}

Thanks to \( b_p \) being anonimized in the same way that \( p_o \) and \( p_d \), we can match bank users to their mobile phones, and add income data to \( G \) as \( g_s \). The subset of calls \( H \subset G \) where both users have income information from the bank has \( ? \) users.


\subsection{Demographic Inference}

Given the set of gender and age data in the Ground Truth \( \left| G_{GT} \right| = 1805534 \), and the set of calls made by the users, we can use the Reaction Diffusion algorithm \cite{brea2014} to extend the inference to all of \( G_N \).
