\section{Inference Methodology}

%For the SEI:

%Census data + geolocalization + ARPU + cellphone payments (recharges)  --> SEI estimation for geolocalized users. 

%Second, we extended our predictions taking advantage of graph structure and socioeconomic homophily. To this end, we considered a bayesian  


For the Income prediction:

Generation of the Income ground truth

In order to infer the socioeconomic level of users on the social graph we take advantage of both, banking data of monthly salaries in a subset of users and high order correlations given by link connections in our cellphone communication graph. 
First of all, we define our ground truth of monthly salary per user by considering banking data of salaries. More precisely, by a given user in our graph $u_i$ we compute his/her average monthly wage, we as the average user in a six month windows.  

In order to propagate the income prediction to others users in our graph, we address a statistical inference of income categories in our directed graph. To this end, we first have checked a underlaying the hypothesis of homophily, i.e that users of high socioeconomic level trends to relate with others of similar status.
