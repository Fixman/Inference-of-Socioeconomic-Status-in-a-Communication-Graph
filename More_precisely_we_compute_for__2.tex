More precisely, we compute for each user $ g \in \mathlarger{G} $, we define its call distribution across the defined income categories as $ \alpha_1 $, the fraction of calls to wealthy users, and $ \alpha_0 $, the fraction of calls to poor users. These calls distributions were used as the parametrization vector of a \textbf{Dirichlet distribution} $D(\alpha_p)$ for each user $ p \in P $. We can interpret the sample space of $ D(\alpha_p) $ as a discrete probability distribution and considering out initial assumption of data homophily homophily, we expect that users belonging to a certain category tend to be concentrated to this particular category.
