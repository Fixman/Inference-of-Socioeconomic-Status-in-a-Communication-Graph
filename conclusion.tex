\section{Conclusion}

This work is based on a combined data source 
from mobile phone records and banking information.
We show the presence of homophily respect to the monthly income in the 
communication graph (i.e. users of similar income tend to communicate more with each other).
We present a methodology based on this homophily, 
that we use to infer income categories for users in the graph for which we don't have 
banking information, by taking a Bayesian approach.
To distinguish users in two income categories, we used the Beta distribution,
and validated our approach by .....
We also presented how this approach can be extended to multiple categories by using
the Dirichlet distribution.
This inference has a high value in practice, 
since it provides as estimation of socio-economic attributes of users lacking 
banking history, based on their communication network.
